# Gmail ui clone

I developed a UI clone of Gmail using React, styled-components, and Material-UI components. This project replicates the visual design and layout of Gmail. By utilizing React, styled-components, and Material-UI, I created a responsive and visually appealing user interface that closely resembles the popular email service. This project demonstrates my ability to build complex UI components.
